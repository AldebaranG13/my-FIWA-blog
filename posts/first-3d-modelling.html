                Have you ever got the time where your teacher suddenly assigns you a task that you have never even learned about? Well that happened to me 2 weeks ago, in the evening of Thursday. 
                I brought my Raspberry Pi 3, Raspberry Pi 4, and also an Orange Pi PC to my FIRotics (FIWA Robotics) class, because I thought; "I think this thing would be more useful if I brought it to school rather than dusting in my computer desk".
            </p>

            <img src="../images/3-computers.png" alt="From left to right; Orange Pi PC, Raspberry Pi 3, Raspberry Pi 4">
            
            <p>
            Then I asked my Ustadz, Told him where I got that (which would probably be in a future post), Asked him what should I do with these three things and asked him to help me put the OS on one of these computers. 
            And coincidentally, the high graders (The 8th, 9th, and 10th graders) were having a competition on who can make the best Cafeteria Absence RFID Card Scanner. 
            </p>

            <p>
            After that coincidence for some reason my Ustadz made me join that internal competititon (if you can even call it that because only the people who participated knows so it's more like a micro competition) just because if I joined a team then my teammates could utilize my Raspberry Pi 3 to use it as the brains of the thing. 
            The good thing is Ustadz will give the winning team a martabak (some kind of folded pancake that you can commonly find in Indonesian streets) and a chance to participate in a bigger competition. 
            And so I made the decision to give it a go and get that martabak (this thing is rare in my school) and the chance of getting into a bigger competition.
