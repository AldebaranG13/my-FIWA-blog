                Have you ever got the time where your teacher suddenly assigns you a task that you have never even learned about? Well that happened to me 2 weeks ago, in the evening of Thursday. I brought my Raspberry PI 3, Raspberry PI 4, and also an Orange PI PC to my FIRotics (FIWA Robotics) class, because I thought "I think this thing would be more useful if I brought it to school rather than dusting in my computer desk".

            Then I asked my Ustadz, Told him where I got that (which would probably be in a future post), Asked him what should I do with these three things and asked him to help me put the OS on one of these computers. And coincidentally, the high graders (The 8th, 9th, and 10th graders) were having a competition on who can make the best Cafeteria Absence RFID Card Scanner.
